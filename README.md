# ImageDenoisingUNet

This repository contains code for performing image denoising using the U-Net architecture. The U-Net is a deep learning model commonly used for image segmentation tasks, but it can also be applied to image denoising.

The code is provided in the ImageDenoisingUNet.ipynb notebook, which can be opened either with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. If you want to open the notebook with Jupyter Notebook you need to install all the necessary libraries. If you want to open the notebook with Google Colab, you can simply open it on GitHub and change the domain from 'github.com' to 'githubtocolab.com'.

Some results of image denoising using the U-Net architecture are located in the Results folder. Few examples are shown in the following figures:
